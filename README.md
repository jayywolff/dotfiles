#Jay's dotfiles

Some configurations/keybindings are specific to Arch Linux and the keyboard of my thinkpad
I may also add my debian i3-config in the future since it's more lightweight than my archbox
I need to clean out alot of junk. This is a work in progress. Currently in beta. 
Still need to add configs for irssi, mpd & ncmpcpp, & urxvt

##To recreate a minimal install with my current setup
  * Install Arch Linux or Net Install of Debian
  
  * Install i3wm-gaps, lightdm, dmenu2, i3status, i3-lock-wrapper, i3bar, gvim, python2, powerline, compton, ranger

  * Copy over dotfiles to ~/

  * Install fonts (Terminus, FontAwesome, Terminess Powerline, Inconsolata for Powerline)

  * Fix everything that's broken
